# Christmas Tree for Everyone ðŸŽ„

## Project Overview

This project, *Christmas Tree for Everyone*, is a heartfelt 3D visualization built using Three.js. At its center is a beautifully rendered Christmas tree, surrounded by snowflakes and festive elements, symbolizing unity, love, and hope. 

The project is inspired by my personal experience living in Myanmar, a country torn by war. Families, friends, and loved ones are scattered across different places, unable to reunite due to the ongoing conflict. Despite not being a Christian or initially having an affinity for Christmas, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate its universal message of togetherness, joy, and goodwill.

This project is my way of wishing for a world where families and friends can come together, celebrate, and share moments of love and happinessâ€”no matter their circumstances. Through this digital Christmas tree, I extend my warm wishes for peace, unity, and a Merry Christmas to everyone.
